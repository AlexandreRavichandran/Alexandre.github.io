description: Clone of Quora website, a forum to ask and answer to some questions

<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>This project is my second experience with Symfony. It's inspired a lot by Quora, a forum where users can ask a question and answer to other user's questions. Since this website looks like a social network (with a like/dislike system, comments, subscriptions...), I have found that it would be a good challenge to create a clone of Quora, with all its features. I spend a lot of time on this website, so I knew most of the features that the clone should have. I have also took the opportunity of this new project to try another CSS framework, TailwindCSS.</p>
<p>Like the previous project, I didn't spend a lot of time on the front-end so that the clone look 100% like the original website, but I focused on the back-end features. </p>
<p>I was also focused on the syntax of my code to respect <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices.html">Symfony good practices</a> for example Yoda conditions, dependancy injections, variable names...</p>
