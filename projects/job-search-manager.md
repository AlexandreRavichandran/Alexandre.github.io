<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>This project is a clone of the Pole Emploi's MEMO application. This application is useful to track your job applications, see which job you have applied, which job you have to relaunch, and add notes/actions that you made for these applications. You can also import applications datas such as title, description, company name.. directly from job search website like Indeed, Welcome to the jungle...</p>
<p>This project was a turning point of my developper's path. Indeed, it's my first project since I learnt Java and Angular. Therefore, this project was a real challenge to me. The main advantage was the fact that Spring boot work almost like Symfony framework, so I was able to adapt to this new framework quickly. I was a little scared about going from PHP to Java (which is a typed language) but finally it was relatively easy for me to to the transition.</p>
<p>This project was also the opportunity for me to use scrappers, something that I knew but didn't used yet, to scrap datas from job application websites.</p>
<p>For the frontend part, i already made a small Angular application (which was a simple To-do-list) but this project was the opportunity to test angular material UI tools.</p>
