<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>This project is a basic to-do-list, which permits to create a task, edit it, archive it once the task is done, and finally delete it. The user can also filter all tasks to display only finished tasks, current tasks and archived tasks</p>
<p>This project is my first project in Angular. I wanted to learn Angular because, like React, it permits to solve a lot of issues that I faced when I did all my front-end sections without any projects on my previous projects, like the routing system, or component system which permits to transfer datas way more easier.</p>
<p>There is no back-end for this project, all created tasks will disappear on refreshing the website. However, the code has been made so that the connection with a back-end can be easily implemented.</p>
<p>This project was also an opportunity to discover deployment with Surge, which permits to deploy a front-end project quickly and with no cost.</p>
