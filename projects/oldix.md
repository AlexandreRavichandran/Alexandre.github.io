<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>This project has been made as part of the O'clock school. It was done as a team, with two front-end developers and three back-end developers, including me.</p>
<p>Oldix is an application which gathers royalty-free films and permit to search and watch them. The application permits to search one or several movies by their categories, thematics or their languages. It's also possible for the application to generate a list of 20 random movies. Oldix has also an user section to register and post comments about the movie, and rate them. Finally, it's possible for the user to add a movie as favorite and define his favorite categories and thematics, so that the application can recommand movies related to the user's preferences.</p>
<p>The project is the first project that I made with a team.The main difficulty between a project made alone and a project made with a team is the task synchronization, but also the uniformity of the code. To prevent these difficulties, we have set code standards and GIT versionning standards so that the code will be uniform and we can prevent code conflicts. After a short period of adaptation, the team quickly got used to the rules.</p>

<p>For this project,I have worked <span style="font-weight:bold">only</span> on the back-end section.</p>
