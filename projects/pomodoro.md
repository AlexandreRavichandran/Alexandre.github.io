<h3>Presentation</h3>
<p>The pomodoro-timer is a project that I made to validate my Javascript skills. The POMODORO technique is a method which permits to upgrade focus and productivity. This method consists in alternating between work time and rest time, for a certain cycle. I have started to use this method when I was self-taught on web development, so I have decided to create a customizable pomodoro timer. Since its creation, I always use this timer when I work on a personnal project, to upgrade my productivity.</p>
